## Almost there

This course outlined the basics of :
- Designer
- Pulse & GCXI Reporting
- Workspace Web Edition

With these building blocks you will be able to build a demo framework.

## Next Step

Now that you have a demo framework in place, the last step of the course is to bring your framework into a real world example. 
Find a customer or buisness that you work with that could utilize the tools we have reviewd and contextualize the framework for their buisness. 

For example: 

ACNE Corporation is a fictional compay that specializes in the sale of Pianos and Heavy Duty Safes. 
This company has numerous agents who need to be fluent in a variety of languages managing their contact center as they exclusively process orders over the phone. 
They have some newer agents who require an increased level of supervision and thus their supervisor has developed a Widget within Pulse reporting to monitor their performance.

This is just one brief example, see if you can find other examples in your field.
